Chocolate Rain
===========

A Cocoa based remote front-end for rTorrent, I started this after getting extremely frustrated with wxPython on OS X while building [wrTc]
 
Requires eczarny's [XMLRPC.Framework][xmlrpc] to build.

Planned Features
-------------
 - Those already implemented by [wrTc]
     - Torrent File Handling
         - Loading torrent from disk and sending raw data to rTorrent
     - Remote Filesystem browsing
     - Scheduled updates of displayed torrents
 - New features
     - Starting/Stopping/Removing torrents
     - Filtering the torrent list (done)
     - Detail view for individual torrent
